## Water Tank Automation Project
  
## Getting Started

This project aims to solve my personal house problem where I had no idea when the water in the tank above the house was filled or empty. So here we have our very own custom solution using ESP32 and an ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level of the tank and using my favorite development tool to convert my ideas to life, ##Flutter!
